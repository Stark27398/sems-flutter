# Initial Commands

 flutter channel beta 
 flutter upgrade
 flutter config --enable-web
 
 flutter run -d chrome // to run in debug mode
 flutter run -d --release chrome // to run in release mode
 
 # Instructions
 
 Initially run the application in release mode (due to flutter-web bug in windows)
 Incase of any changes, quit release mode (since it will take more time to reload) and run in debug mode for quick hot-reload
